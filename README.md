I am starting this GitHub thread to discuss 3D printing for IoT devices.

There are several project discussions:
- Adapter Plates for commercial Project Boxes
- Header Spacer for supporting Featherwings to Protoboards and Carrier Boards
- 3D printed Project Boxes for indoor use
- 3D printed Project Boxes for outdoor or extreme conditions
- Misc topics as they come up!


This is a work in progress - I am open to suggestions and ideas!
