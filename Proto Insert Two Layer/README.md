Divide and Conquer

I was having issues printing the adapter plate; the file was taking too long to print, cleaning the support material was time consuming and the threads in the standoffs were never accurate. After many hours of thought, trial and error I realized there was a better way - 3D printing is an art as much as a science.

My first approach was to print the plate on the long thin edge because there were top standoffs and bottom standoff supports. Printing this required support material and meant printing the entire plate as one file; any changes required entirely reprinting the plate. 

So I ‘cut’ the plate horizontally in two with Fusion, separating the top and bottom elements of the design.

The bottom plate is mirrored to the top plate with the battery compartment. Edges in the bottom plate align with the edges in the top plate battery cutout. The top plate keeps the bottom plate down and secure. I also added a slot for the cellular antenna on the bottom plate; after much trial and error I crafted it so that the top plate becomes the roof of the antenna slot.

The top plate design didn’t change much but I did discover a very cool feature of the Prusa Slicer (and I’m sure other slicers). When slicing the .stl file one can set a layer to pause the print for a color change. In my case I was able to print the top plate base layer white (Prusament PETG Signal White) and the top layer black (Prusament PETG Jet Black). I set the divide point just below the logo layer so that the logo is white on a black mounting plate. So cool!

Truly the amount of work that went into the final design is overkill for my specific case but I see this as an easy way to prototype the idea for other uses. One can learn a lot on a simple project such as this. And the many great ideas added by the community on this thread will help to build the next phase of the design.

I have included the .stl and .f3d files with photos on the GitHub page. As always please enjoy.
